## My process
first the page structure, then the elements, then the styles

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [hsl to hex converter](https://htmlcolors.com/hsl-to-hex) - I'm used to using "#hex" notation for colors, so this link came in handy to make the conversion from 'hsl'

- [markdown info](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) - a good reference for markdown syntax
